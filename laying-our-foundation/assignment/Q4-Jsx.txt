4. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.

    {TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expession or a value. The {} can embed a javascript expression or a values inside it.

    <TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. in simple terms TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. A compoenet is written inside the {<  />} expression.

    <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> : <TitleComponent /> and <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has no children components.The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.

e.g.

<TitleComponent>
    <ChildComponen1 />
    <ChildComponen2 />
    <ChildComponen3 />
</TitleComponent>

In JSX, there are different ways to render components, and each syntax variation has its own implications:

1. **{TitleComponent}**: This syntax is used to reference a component without rendering it directly. It is typically used when you want to pass a component as a prop or store it in a variable for later use. For example:

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ titleComponent }) => {
  return <div>{titleComponent}</div>;
};

const App = () => {
  const titleComponent = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
  return <MyComponent titleComponent={titleComponent} />;
};
```

2. **{<TitleComponent/>}**: This syntax is used to render the component directly in JSX. It creates an instance of the `TitleComponent` and renders it at that location. The component will be instantiated and rendered with any defined props. For example:

```jsx
const TitleComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
};

const App = () => {
  return <div>{<TitleComponent/>}</div>;
};
```

3. **{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}**: This syntax is equivalent to the previous one, but it includes explicit opening and closing tags for the component. This syntax is typically used when the component has nested content or when you want to provide additional properties to the component. For example:

```jsx
const TitleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello, <span>JSX</span>!
    </h1>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return <div>{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}</div>;
};
```

All three syntax variations accomplish similar tasks, but their usage may vary depending on the specific scenario and requirements of your application.
