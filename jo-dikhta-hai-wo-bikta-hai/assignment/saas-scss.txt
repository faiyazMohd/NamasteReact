SCSS (Sassy CSS) and Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) are two different but related CSS preprocessor scripting languages that extend the capabilities of standard CSS. They both add features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and more, making CSS code more maintainable and easier to write.

1. Sass:
Sass was the original language and is an older version of the CSS preprocessor. It introduced a new syntax for writing stylesheets, which involved the use of significant whitespace and indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons like in standard CSS. Sass files use the `.sass` extension.

Example Sass code:

```sass
$primary-color: #007bff

body
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif
  color: $primary-color

.header
  background-color: $primary-color
```

2. SCSS:
SCSS is a newer version of Sass and stands for "Sassy CSS." It uses a syntax that closely resembles standard CSS, making it easier for developers familiar with CSS to transition to SCSS. The SCSS syntax uses curly braces and semicolons like regular CSS. SCSS files use the `.scss` extension.

Example SCSS code:

```scss
$primary-color: #007bff;

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: $primary-color;
}

.header {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
```

Both Sass and SCSS are compiled into standard CSS before being used in a web project. The CSS preprocessor takes care of translating the Sass or SCSS code into regular CSS, which browsers can understand.

Choosing between Sass and SCSS is mostly a matter of preference and team conventions. Some developers prefer the concise syntax of Sass, while others prefer the familiar syntax of SCSS. Both options offer similar capabilities, and the choice ultimately comes down to what feels more comfortable and maintainable for you and your team.
