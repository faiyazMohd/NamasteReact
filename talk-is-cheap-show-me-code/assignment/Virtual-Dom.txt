What is the Virtual DOM?

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.

Since “virtual DOM” is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept and technique used in React to improve the efficiency of updating the user interface (UI). It is not specific to React, but React popularized and made it widely used in modern frontend web development.

In traditional web development, when the state of an application changes, the entire DOM (Document Object Model) is recalculated and updated to reflect the changes. This process can be computationally expensive and inefficient, especially for large and complex applications, as it requires re-rendering and updating the entire DOM tree.

The Virtual DOM, as the name suggests, is a virtual representation of the actual DOM. It is a lightweight copy of the real DOM and serves as an intermediate layer between the application's state and the actual DOM. When there are changes to the state of the application, React doesn't immediately update the real DOM. Instead, it first creates a new Virtual DOM with the updated state.

After generating the updated Virtual DOM, React performs a process called "reconciliation." It compares the previous Virtual DOM (before the state change) with the updated Virtual DOM (after the state change) using a diffing algorithm. This process efficiently identifies the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM to match the updated Virtual DOM.

By identifying the minimal changes needed, React optimizes the updating process and minimizes the number of manipulations required on the actual DOM. The changes are then batched and applied in a single update to the real DOM, reducing the performance overhead and enhancing the overall UI rendering speed.

Benefits of the Virtual DOM include:

1. Improved Performance: By minimizing DOM updates, the Virtual DOM reduces the performance overhead, making UI updates more efficient and responsive.

2. Abstraction: Developers can work with a declarative and abstract representation of the UI (Virtual DOM) rather than dealing with direct DOM manipulation, which can be error-prone and complex.

3. Cross-platform Compatibility: Since the Virtual DOM is a concept independent of the actual DOM implementation, it enables React to work not only in web browsers (using the browser's DOM) but also in other environments like React Native (for mobile app development) and server-side rendering (for better SEO and initial page load performance).

Overall, the Virtual DOM is a core part of React's approach to building efficient, scalable, and high-performing user interfaces by optimizing the process of updating and rendering components.


The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an essential concept in React and other modern JavaScript frameworks because it provides several significant benefits that improve the performance and maintainability of web applications. Here are some reasons why the Virtual DOM is valuable and why it is used in React:

1. Efficient DOM Updates: The Virtual DOM allows React to minimize the number of updates made to the actual DOM. Instead of directly updating the DOM on every state change, React first calculates the difference between the previous Virtual DOM and the updated Virtual DOM using a process called "reconciliation." This process identifies the minimal changes needed to update the real DOM, reducing unnecessary DOM manipulations and improving performance.

2. Faster Rendering: By using the Virtual DOM, React can efficiently batch and optimize DOM updates, resulting in faster rendering and improved user experience. The Virtual DOM updates the real DOM in a single batch, reducing layout thrashing and reflows, which can be resource-intensive.

3. Declarative Programming: React allows developers to describe the UI using a declarative programming style. Instead of imperatively manipulating the DOM, developers can express how the UI should look at any given state, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM accordingly. This abstraction provided by the Virtual DOM simplifies the development process and makes the code more maintainable.

4. Cross-platform Compatibility: The Virtual DOM is not tied to any specific platform or environment. As a result, React can work not only in web browsers using the browser's DOM but also in other environments like React Native (for mobile app development) and server-side rendering (for better SEO and initial page load performance). The ability to reuse components across different platforms is a significant advantage of using the Virtual DOM.

5. Improved Developer Experience: The Virtual DOM allows developers to work with a lightweight copy of the real DOM, which provides a better developer experience. This abstraction makes it easier to reason about the UI's state and behavior, leading to fewer bugs and faster development cycles.

6. Incremental Updates: The Virtual DOM enables React to perform incremental updates. Instead of recalculating and updating the entire DOM, React can focus only on the parts that changed, which further improves the performance and reduces rendering time.

Overall, the Virtual DOM is a fundamental component of React's architecture, contributing to its popularity and widespread adoption in modern web development. It enables developers to build efficient, scalable, and high-performing user interfaces while providing a better development experience and increased maintainability of code.
