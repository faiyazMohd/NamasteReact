Q: Difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM?

A: DOM stands for Document Object Model, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.

    Virtual DOM
        The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn’t have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
        Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
        Reconciliation is a process to compare and keep in sync the two files (Real and Virtual DOM). Diffing algorithm is a technique of reconciliation which is used by React.
    Real DOM
        The DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each branch of the tree ends in a node and each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting language like javascript and the changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but after changes, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you need to be rendered for every dom update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update .

            Real DOM 	                                Virtual DOM
DOM manipulation is very expensive 	        DOM manipulation is very easy
There is too much memory wastage 	        No memory wastage
It updates Slow 	                        It updates fast
It can directly update HTML 	            It can’t update HTML directly
Creates a new DOM if the element updates.   Update the JSX if the element update
It allows us to directly target
 any specific node (HTML element) 	        It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second.
It represents the UI of your application 	It is only a virtual representation of the DOM

The Virtual DOM and the Real DOM are both representations of the Document Object Model (DOM) used in web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a comparison of the Virtual DOM and the Real DOM:

Virtual DOM:
1. Concept: The Virtual DOM is an abstraction or lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
2. Purpose: It is used as an intermediate representation to improve the efficiency of UI updates and rendering in frameworks like React.
3. Nature: Virtual DOM is entirely JavaScript-based and lives in memory.
4. Operations: It allows for quick, in-memory manipulations and comparisons without directly affecting the actual DOM.
5. Rendering: When there are changes in the application's state, a new Virtual DOM is generated and compared with the previous one.
6. Diffing: The Virtual DOM efficiently calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the real DOM.
7. Efficiency: Virtual DOM updates are batched and optimized, reducing the number of direct DOM manipulations, which improves performance.
8. Usage: It is mostly used in frameworks like React and Vue.js.

Real DOM:
1. Concept: The Real DOM is the actual tree-like structure of the HTML elements and nodes in the web page.
2. Purpose: It represents the current state of the web page and allows direct interaction with the user interface.
3. Nature: The Real DOM is provided by the browser and is part of the web page's document.
4. Operations: Any changes to the Real DOM trigger browser reflows and repaints, which can be computationally expensive.
5. Rendering: When changes are applied directly to the Real DOM, the browser has to recalculate the entire layout and render the updates, which can cause performance bottlenecks.
6. Diffing: The Real DOM does not perform automatic diffing like the Virtual DOM. It directly reflects any changes made to the web page.
7. Efficiency: Real DOM updates can be slower compared to the Virtual DOM, especially when dealing with large and complex web pages.
8. Usage: It is used whenever direct manipulation of the web page is required, such as in native JavaScript interactions or when not using Virtual DOM-based frameworks.

In summary, the Virtual DOM acts as a lightweight, efficient representation of the Real DOM. It allows frameworks like React to optimize rendering and reduce the number of direct DOM manipulations, leading to improved performance and a more responsive user interface. The Real DOM, on the other hand, is the actual browser-provided document tree, responsible for rendering the web page and directly handling user interactions.
