Emmet is a web development productivity tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. It was originally called Zen Coding and was created by Sergey Chikuyonok in 2008. Emmet is now widely used and has become an essential tool for many web developers.

Emmet provides a set of abbreviations, or shortcuts, that expand into HTML or CSS code snippets. These abbreviations are designed to be intuitive and easy to remember, allowing developers to quickly generate complex code structures with minimal typing. For example, you can type `ul>li.item$*5` and Emmet will expand it into:

```html
<ul>
  <li class="item1"></li>
  <li class="item2"></li>
  <li class="item3"></li>
  <li class="item4"></li>
  <li class="item5"></li>
</ul>
```

Emmet supports a wide range of abbreviations and features, including nesting elements, sibling relationships, numbering, text wrapping, and more. It also integrates with popular code editors and IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom, providing seamless integration and enhancing the developer's workflow.

Overall, Emmet is a powerful tool for speeding up web development by allowing developers to write code faster, reducing the need for repetitive typing and improving productivity.
