Q: What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?

A: A JS expression returns a value that we use in the application. for example:

1 + 2 // expresses 
"foo".toUpperCase() // expresses 'FOO'
console.log(2) // logs '2'
isTrue ? true : false // returns us a true or false value based on isTrue value

A JS statement, does not return a value. for example:

let x; // variable declaration
if () { } // if condition

If we want to use JS expression in JSX, we have to wrap in {/* expression slot */} and if we want to use JS statement in JSX, we have to wrap in {(/* statement slot */)}

In JavaScript, expressions and statements are two fundamental concepts that play different roles in the language. Understanding the difference between them is essential for writing effective and meaningful JavaScript code.

**JavaScript Expression:**
An expression in JavaScript is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. It can be as simple as a single value or involve complex computations. Expressions can consist of variables, literals, operators, and function calls. Every expression has a value associated with it.

Examples of JavaScript expressions:

```javascript
// Literal expression
5

// Arithmetic expression
2 + 3 * (4 - 1)

// Variable expression
let x = 10;
x + 5

// Function call expression
Math.sqrt(25)

// Ternary (conditional) expression
x > 0 ? 'positive' : 'non-positive'
```

In the above examples, each line represents a JavaScript expression that yields a specific value. Expressions can be used anywhere in JavaScript where a value is expected, such as in assignments, function arguments, or as part of larger expressions.

**JavaScript Statement:**
A statement in JavaScript is a complete instruction that performs an action. Unlike expressions, statements do not produce a value. Instead, they are executed for their side effects. Side effects can include changing the state of variables, controlling the flow of the program, or interacting with the environment (e.g., input/output operations).

Examples of JavaScript statements:

```javascript
// Variable declaration statement
let x;

// Assignment statement
x = 5;

// Control flow statement (if-else)
if (x > 0) {
  console.log('Positive');
} else {
  console.log('Non-positive');
}

// Loop statement (for loop)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Function declaration statement
function greet(name) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
}
```

In the above examples, each line represents a JavaScript statement. Statements are used to control the program's flow, perform actions, and organize the logic of the code.

**Key Difference:**
The primary difference between expressions and statements is that expressions evaluate to a value, while statements perform actions or control the program flow but do not produce a value.

It's important to note that in some cases, expressions can be used as statements. For example, function calls, assignments, and declarations can be used as standalone statements.

```javascript
// Expression used as a statement (function call)
console.log('Hello, World!');

// Expression used as a statement (assignment)
let x = 10;

// Expression used as a statement (declaration)
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

However, not all expressions can be used as statements. For instance, arithmetic expressions or ternary expressions cannot be used directly as statements. Instead, they are often used as part of larger expressions or within the context of statements.

In summary, expressions produce values, and statements perform actions or control the flow of a JavaScript program. Both expressions and statements are crucial elements in JavaScript programming, and understanding their distinctions is essential for writing effective code.


//what is the trick to add statements inside our jsx 


To incorporate statements or more complex logic inside JSX, you can use JavaScript block statements (`{}`) with immediately-invoked arrow functions. This technique allows you to execute statements and multiple lines of code within JSX.

Here's the trick to include statements or complex logic inside JSX:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isLoggedIn = true;

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Trick to use statements within JSX */}
      {(() => {
        if (isLoggedIn) {
          // Statements or complex logic here
          return (
            <p>Welcome back, user!</p>
          );
        } else {
          // Statements or complex logic here
          return (
            <p>Hello, guest!</p>
          );
        }
      })()}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we use an immediately-invoked arrow function, which creates a function that is executed immediately after its definition. Within the function, you can include JavaScript statements and multiple lines of code, making it suitable for more complex logic.

The `if` statement is used to conditionally render different JSX elements based on the value of the `isLoggedIn` variable. Depending on the condition, either the "Welcome back, user!" or "Hello, guest!" message will be rendered.

This technique works because the immediately-invoked arrow function returns the JSX elements, allowing them to be rendered within the outer JSX.

While this trick enables you to include statements inside JSX, it's crucial to use it judiciously. For simple cases, using ternary expressions or logical operators for conditional rendering is often more concise and easier to read. Reserve this technique for scenarios where you need to include multiple statements or more complex logic within JSX. Always strive to maintain code readability and avoid unnecessary complexity.
