Q: What is the use of const json = await data.json(); in getRestaurants()?

A: The data object, returned by the await fetch(), is a generic placeholder for multiple data formats. so we can extract the JSON object from a fetch response by using await data.json(). data.json() is a method on the data object that lets you extract a JSON object from the data or response. The method returns a promise because we have used await keyword. so data.json() returns a promise resolved to a JSON object.

In JavaScript, the `json()` method is a built-in method provided by the `Response` interface in the Fetch API. The Fetch API is used to make network requests and interact with server resources asynchronously. The `json()` method is specifically used to parse the response body of a Fetch request as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

When you make a network request using the Fetch API, the server typically responds with data in a specific format, such as JSON, XML, or plain text. The `json()` method is specifically designed to handle JSON responses.

Here's how the `json()` method works:

1. **Sending a Fetch Request:**
You use the Fetch API's `fetch()` function to make a request to a server. The response from the server is returned as a `Response` object.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

2. **Parsing JSON Response:**
Once you have the `Response` object, you can use the `json()` method to parse the JSON data from the response body. The `json()` method returns a promise that resolves with the JSON data extracted from the response.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    return response.json(); // Parse JSON data
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the JSON data
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

3. **Handling the JSON Data:**
In the `.then()` callback, you receive the parsed JSON data, which can now be accessed as a JavaScript object.

4. **Error Handling:**
The `json()` method returns a promise, so it's important to handle errors using `.catch()`. If the response body is not a valid JSON or cannot be parsed, the promise will be rejected, and the error will be caught in the `.catch()` block.

Using the `json()` method allows you to easily work with JSON data returned from the server and convert it into a usable JavaScript object. It simplifies the process of handling JSON responses in Fetch API requests.z
