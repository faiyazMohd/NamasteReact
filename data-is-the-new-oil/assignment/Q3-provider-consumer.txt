3. What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?

    Context Provider is used to provide access to a context between multiple components of the application. We can provide the access to the context or the data layer to the whole application to the and its subcomponents.

    For example:

    return (
      <UserContext.Provider value={{ user: user, setUser: setUser }}>
        <Head />
        <Outlet />
        <Footer />
      </UserContext.Provider>
    );

In the code above , we are providing the access of UserContext to <Head /> <Outlet /> and <Footer /> component

Context Consumer is used to consume the context data , provided by react context. We can do this using useContext hook for functional components and Context.Consumer in clasees based components.

For example:

    In Class based components, we can use the Context and use the consumer.

    <UserContext.Consumer>
      {({ user }) => <h1>{user.name}</h1>}
    </UserContext.Consumer>

In Functional components we can use useContext hook to consume the context.

import UserContext from "../utils/UserContext";
import { useContext } from "react";

const { user } = useContext(UserContext);

In React, the Context API is a feature that allows you to manage and share state across different components without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. The Context API consists of two main parts: Context Provider and Context Consumer.

1. **Context Provider:**
The Context Provider is a component that provides the data (state) that you want to share with other components. It wraps a portion of your component tree and makes the provided data accessible to any component that subscribes to it using a Context Consumer.

Here's a simplified example:

```jsx
// Creating a context
const MyContext = React.createContext();

// In your component tree
<MyContext.Provider value={/* your data */}>
  {/* Children components */}
</MyContext.Provider>
```

In this example, the `MyContext.Provider` component wraps the part of the component tree where you want to make the data available. The `value` prop is where you provide the data that you want to share.

2. **Context Consumer:**
The Context Consumer is a component that subscribes to the data provided by the Context Provider. It allows components deeper in the tree to access the shared data without needing to pass props through intermediary components.

```jsx
// In a child component
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => (
    // Use the value provided by the Context Provider
  )}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

In this example, the `MyContext.Consumer` component wraps a function that receives the value provided by the Context Provider as its argument. You can then use this value in your component as needed.

The Context API is especially useful when you have data that needs to be accessed by multiple components at different levels of your application's component tree. It helps avoid prop drilling, where you would have to pass data through multiple layers of components just to reach a specific component that needs it.

However, it's worth noting that the Context API might not be the best solution for all types of state management scenarios. For more complex state management needs, you might consider using third-party libraries like Redux or MobX.
