Q: What is the importance of config.js file?

A: config.js files are essentially editable text files that contain information required for the successful operation of a program. The files are structured in a particular way, formatted to be user configurable. Most of the computer programs we use: whether office suites, web browsers, even video games are configured via menu interfaces. Configuration files are very simple in structure. For instance, if you were to write an application, and the only thing it ever needed to know was its user's preferred name, then its one and only config file could contain exactly one word: the name of the user. For example:

Chetan

Usually, though, an application needs to keep track of more than just one piece of information, so configuration often uses a key and a value:

NAME='Chetan'
SURNAME='Nada'

//src 2
config.js file is used for the hard coded values used in our application. We can use it import a configration in side any component without having to copy it over and over again.
