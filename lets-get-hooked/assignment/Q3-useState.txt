Q: Why do we need useState Hook?

A: useState hook is used to maintain the state in our React application. It keeps track of the state changes so basically useState has the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component. The useState hook is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries. UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls.
Syntax for useState hook

const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate);

Importing: To use useState you need to import useState from react as shown below:

import React, { useState } from "react";

we can use Hooks in Functional Components

const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}

The `useState` Hook is a fundamental part of React Hooks and serves a crucial role in functional components. It allows functional components to have their own local state, which was previously only possible in class components. Here are the main reasons why we need the `useState` Hook:

1. **State Management**: With `useState`, functional components can manage stateful data within the component itself. This enables components to hold and update data over time, making them more dynamic and interactive.

2. **Avoiding Class Components**: Before the introduction of Hooks, stateful logic and lifecycle management were only possible with class components. `useState` provides an alternative to class components, allowing developers to use functional components for most use cases.

3. **Simplicity and Readability**: `useState` makes state management more straightforward and concise. It reduces the boilerplate code often associated with class components, leading to more readable and maintainable code.

4. **Decoupling State Logic**: By using `useState`, stateful logic can be localized to the component where it is needed, promoting better separation of concerns and making the code easier to reason about.

5. **Functional Programming**: Hooks encourage functional programming practices by promoting pure functions and making stateful logic more predictable and easier to test.

6. **State Re-rendering**: When the state changes using `useState`, React automatically triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state. This ensures that the UI stays in sync with the data.

7. **Multiple State Variables**: A single functional component can use multiple `useState` calls to manage multiple state variables independently. This allows components to handle complex state requirements with ease.

Here's a simple example using the `useState` Hook to manage state in a functional component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initializes state variable count with 0

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Updates the state variable count
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `useState` Hook is used to create a state variable `count` and its associated updater function `setCount`. Whenever the button is clicked, the `increment` function updates the state by calling `setCount`, and React automatically re-renders the component with the updated count value.

Overall, the `useState` Hook is a powerful tool that enables functional components to handle and manage local state, leading to more flexible and feature-rich React applications.
