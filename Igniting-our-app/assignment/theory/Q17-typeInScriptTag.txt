The `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag is used to specify the MIME type of the script being included. It helps the browser understand how to interpret and execute the script code.

There are two common values used for the `type` attribute:

1. `type="text/javascript"` (default):
   - If the `type` attribute is not specified or set to `"text/javascript"`, it indicates that the content of the `<script>` tag is JavaScript code.
   - This value has been the default for many years, and most modern browsers assume JavaScript when the `type` attribute is omitted.

2. `type="module"`:
   - The `type="module"` value is used to indicate that the script is an ECMAScript module. ECMAScript modules are a standardized way of organizing and sharing JavaScript code.
   - When the `type` attribute is set to `"module"`, the browser treats the script as an ES module and applies stricter parsing rules. This enables the use of `import` and `export` statements for module dependencies.

It's worth noting that the `type` attribute is not required in HTML5. If you're including JavaScript code and not using ECMAScript modules, you can omit the `type` attribute altogether. Most modern browsers will interpret the content as JavaScript by default.

Here's an example of using the `type` attribute in a `<script>` tag:

```html
<!-- JavaScript code -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  // JavaScript code goes here
</script>

<!-- ECMAScript module -->
<script type="module">
  // ES module code goes here
</script>
```

Remember that when using ECMAScript modules (`type="module"`), there are additional rules and considerations, such as how modules are loaded and the usage of `import` and `export` statements.

The `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag can have various values depending on the type of script you are including. Here are some common values used with the `type` attribute:

1. `text/javascript` (default):
   - This is the default value assumed by most browsers when the `type` attribute is omitted.
   - It indicates that the content of the `<script>` tag is JavaScript code.
   - Example: `<script type="text/javascript"> ... </script>`

2. `module`:
   - This value is used to indicate that the script is an ECMAScript module.
   - It enables the use of `import` and `export` statements for module dependencies.
   - Example: `<script type="module"> ... </script>`

3. `text/ecmascript`:
   - This value is used to specify JavaScript code that adheres to the ECMAScript standard.
   - It is less commonly used in modern web development.
   - Example: `<script type="text/ecmascript"> ... </script>`

4. `application/javascript`:
   - This value is used to indicate that the content is JavaScript code.
   - It is an alternative to `text/javascript` and is used to comply with certain MIME standards.
   - Example: `<script type="application/javascript"> ... </script>`

5. `text/x-javascript`:
   - This value is used to specify JavaScript code but is less commonly used.
   - It was widely used in the past but is now deprecated in favor of `text/javascript`.
   - Example: `<script type="text/x-javascript"> ... </script>`

It's important to note that for modern JavaScript development, the most commonly used `type` value is either `text/javascript` (or omitted) for regular JavaScript code or `module` for ECMAScript modules. The other values mentioned above are less commonly used or have become outdated.

Remember that the HTML5 specification doesn't strictly require the `type` attribute for `<script>` tags. If you're including regular JavaScript code without using modules, you can omit the `type` attribute altogether, and most browsers will interpret it as JavaScript by default.
