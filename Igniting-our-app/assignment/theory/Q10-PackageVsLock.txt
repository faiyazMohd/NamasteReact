3. What is the difference betweeen package.json and package-lock.json.
ans:
package.json :
    this file is mandatory for every project
    It contains basicinformation about the project
    Application name/version/scripts (ng scripts)

package-lock.json :

    This file is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either the node_module tree or package-json.

    It is generated after an npm install

    It allows future devs & automated systems to download the same dependencies as the project.

    it also allows to go back to the past version of the dependencies without actual â€˜committing the node_modules folder.

    It records the same version of the installed packages which allows to reinstall them. Futuee installs wll be capable of building identical description tree.

~ or ^ in package.json file : These are used with the versions of the package installed.

For example in package.json file:

"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }

~ : we can use it for minor version updates for a package.

^ : we can use it for major version updates for a package.

If none of them is present , that means only the version specified in package.json file is used in the development.
