Q: What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?

A: The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project during commit to the repository. The types of files you should consider adding to a .gitignore file are any files that do not need to get committed. for example, For security, the security key files and API keys should get added to the gitignore. package-lock.json should not add into your .gitignore file.

The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.

* is used as a wildcard match
/ is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
# is used to add comments to a .gitignore file

This is an example of what the .gitignore file could look like:

# Ignore Mac system files
.DS_store

# Ignore node_modules folder
node_modules

# Ignore all text files
*.txt

# Ignore files related to API keys
.env

# Ignore SASS config files
.sass-cache

The `.gitignore` file is a text file used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git, a version control system. Git uses the `.gitignore` file to determine which files should not be tracked or included in a repository's history.

Here's how the `.gitignore` file works:

1. Ignoring Files: When Git encounters a file or directory mentioned in the `.gitignore` file, it ignores them and does not include them in the repository.

2. Pattern Matching: The `.gitignore` file uses pattern matching rules to specify which files or directories should be ignored. Patterns can include wildcards, such as `*` for matching any number of characters and `?` for matching a single character.

3. File Placement: The `.gitignore` file is typically placed in the root directory of a Git repository. It affects all the files and directories within that repository, as well as any subdirectories.

Now, let's discuss what you should add and not add to the `.gitignore` file:

What to Add:
- Compiled or built files: This includes files generated by build tools or compilers, such as executables, binary files, or object files. Examples could be `.exe`, `.jar`, `.class`, or `.dll` files.
- Dependency directories: You can add directories that contain dependencies managed by package managers like npm (`node_modules/`), Yarn (`yarn.lock`), or Composer (`vendor/`).
- Editor and IDE-specific files: These are files generated by text editors or IDEs, like `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, or `.DS_Store` (on macOS).

What Not to Add:
- Source code files: Generally, you don't want to add source code files that are essential to your project. Your source code should be version controlled, so others can collaborate and contribute effectively.
- Sensitive or personal data: Avoid adding files containing sensitive information like passwords, access tokens, or personal data to a public repository. Keep them outside version control or use appropriate methods to protect them.

It's important to tailor the `.gitignore` file to your specific project needs. You can find pre-configured `.gitignore` templates for different programming languages, frameworks, or tools from sources like https://github.com/github/gitignore. These templates provide a starting point, and you can modify them or add specific patterns based on your project requirements.

By properly configuring the `.gitignore` file, you can ensure that unnecessary or sensitive files are not tracked by Git, resulting in a cleaner and more secure version control repository.
