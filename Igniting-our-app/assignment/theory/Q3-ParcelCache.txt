Q: What is .parcel-cache?
A: .parcel-cache is used by parcel(bundler) to reduce the building time. It stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

The `.parcel-cache` directory is a folder created by the Parcel bundler during the build process. When Parcel bundles your project's assets, it performs various optimizations, transformations, and caching to improve build speed and performance.

The `.parcel-cache` directory contains cached files and data generated by Parcel during the build process. It stores intermediate artifacts, such as precompiled dependencies, transformed assets, and other build-related information. The cache helps Parcel avoid redundant work and speeds up subsequent builds by reusing previously processed data.

By default, the `.parcel-cache` directory is located in the root directory of your project. It is generally hidden from view, as directories starting with a dot (.) are often considered hidden on Unix-based systems.

It's worth noting that the contents of the `.parcel-cache` directory can change during development as you modify and rebuild your project. However, you typically don't need to directly interact with this directory or modify its contents manually. Parcel manages the cache automatically, and it is safe to leave it as is.

If you encounter issues with the build process or want to start fresh with a clean cache, you can delete the `.parcel-cache` directory. Parcel will recreate it during the next build, and the caching process will start anew.

Remember that removing the `.parcel-cache` directory will cause Parcel to perform a full rebuild, potentially taking more time. It's advisable to delete the cache only when necessary or if you're experiencing problems that could potentially be resolved by clearing the cache.
