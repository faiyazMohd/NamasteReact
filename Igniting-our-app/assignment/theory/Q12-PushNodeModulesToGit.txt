Q: What is node_modules ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

A: node_modules folder like a cache for the external modules that your project depends upon. When you npm install them, they are downloaded from the web and copied into the node_modules folder and Nodejs is trained to look for them there when you import them (without a specific path). Don't push node_modulesin github because it contains lots of files(more than 100 MB), it will cost you memory space.

`node_modules` is a directory that is automatically created by npm (Node Package Manager) when you install packages for a Node.js project. It serves as a location for storing the dependencies (third-party libraries or modules) required by your project.

Regarding whether it is a good idea to push the `node_modules` directory to Git, the general recommendation is to **not** include it in your version control repository. Here are a few reasons:

1. Large Size: The `node_modules` directory can become quite large, especially for projects with numerous dependencies. Including it in your Git repository would significantly increase the size of your repository, making cloning and working with the repository slower and more resource-intensive.

2. Reproducible Builds: By omitting the `node_modules` directory from version control, you ensure that each developer can independently install the necessary dependencies based on the `package.json` file. This allows for reproducible builds, where everyone can have the same versions of dependencies installed, regardless of the operating system or development environment.

3. Dependency Management: npm provides a mechanism to manage and install dependencies through the `package.json` file. By relying on npm to install dependencies based on the `package.json` file, you can easily update, add, or remove dependencies, and ensure consistency across different development environments.

To exclude the `node_modules` directory from Git, you can add it to your `.gitignore` file. By doing so, Git will ignore the directory and its contents when performing version control operations. This keeps your repository clean and focused on your project's source code and configuration.

Instead, it's good practice to include the `package.json` file in your Git repository. This file lists the dependencies required for your project, and by running `npm install` on a fresh clone of the repository, you can install the necessary dependencies and rebuild the `node_modules` directory locally.

By excluding the `node_modules` directory from Git, you maintain a more efficient and manageable repository while ensuring consistent dependency management and reproducible builds across your development team.
