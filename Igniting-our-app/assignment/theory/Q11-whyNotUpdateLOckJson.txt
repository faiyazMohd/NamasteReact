Q: Why should I not modify package-lock.json?

A: package-lock.json file contains the information about the dependencies and their versions used in the project. Deleting it would cause dependencies issues in the production environment. So don't modify it, It's being handled automatically by NPM.

The `package-lock.json` file should generally not be modified manually. Here are a few reasons why it's recommended to avoid making direct modifications to the `package-lock.json` file:

1. Deterministic Dependency Resolution: The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm based on the dependency tree and the specific versions of packages installed in your project. It ensures deterministic builds by recording the exact versions of packages and their dependencies. Modifying the `package-lock.json` file manually can introduce inconsistencies and potentially break the deterministic behavior.

2. Risk of Dependency Conflicts: The `package-lock.json` file is designed to prevent dependency conflicts by ensuring consistent installations across different environments. Manually modifying the file may lead to conflicts, as the manually altered versions may not align with the intended dependencies of other packages or collaborators. This can result in unexpected behavior, errors, or incompatibilities.

3. Overwriting Changes: When running `npm install`, `npm update`, or other dependency-related commands, npm will automatically update the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the resolved versions of packages. If you manually modify the `package-lock.json` file, your changes are likely to be overwritten when npm performs dependency resolution and updates the file. This can lead to confusion, merge conflicts in version control systems, or loss of changes made to the file.

4. Collaboration and Reproducibility: The `package-lock.json` file serves as a shared record of dependencies for collaborators and facilitates reproducible builds. By avoiding manual modifications, you ensure that everyone working on the project uses the same dependency versions recorded in the `package-lock.json` file. This improves collaboration, makes debugging easier, and allows for consistent builds across different environments.

While it's generally not recommended to modify `package-lock.json` manually, if you encounter specific issues or have a valid reason to make a change, it's advised to address the underlying problem instead of directly modifying the file. For example, you can update the relevant dependency version in the `package.json` file and let npm handle the resolution and regeneration of the `package-lock.json` file.
